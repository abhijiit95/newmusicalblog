            Iâ€™m a front-end web developer with some basic project experience.i have started my career with language Python and Django framework.i made some interesting project on e-shopping site and blogging app.Although I'm very familiar with using frameworks, my websites are primarily hand-coded using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

With a strong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance.

In a quest for always keeping myself updated, I read books and attend conferences & meetups.
